The NUS Buffet Response Team (BRT) has created a bot to facilitate matching between leftover buffets from organisers and passer-bys to reduce food waste from catered events. This is the website giving a glimpse of how users can contribute or be subscribed to the timely updates for a well-deserved break!

In April 2017, Hostgagments acquired NUS BRT as its second product acquisition and created the bot, together with this website at the Amazon Web Services Hack Day. This was a fringe event as part of its annual Amazon Web Services Summit.

Hostgagements leads hosting, event management, copywriting and team building requests. Do follow our updates on https://www.instagram.com/angushostgagements/ or Instagram (@angushostgagements)!

We are grateful for the template.
